> We live in a world critically relying on a growing mass of information
> systems: whether it be for APIs, automation, synchronizing services, etc.
> But how does these systems react in case of failure? It is your job to
> implement a resilient system. Through this talk leveraging Node.js, we will
> look into some erroneous implementations and see how we can articulate
> coherent strategies to solve these issues.
