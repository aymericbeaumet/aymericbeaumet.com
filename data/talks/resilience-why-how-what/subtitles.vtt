WEBVTT

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.360
Previously in Etrange escales (extraordinary expeditions) we were in Rome

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.465
and I don't know if you are aware that the only other city paired up with Rome

00:00:05.465 --> 00:00:07.760
is Paris !  and vice versa.

00:00:08.125 --> 00:00:10.495
According to the saying :  "Only Paris lives up to Rome

00:00:10.495 --> 00:00:13.535
and only Rome lives up to Paris."

00:00:13.535 --> 00:00:15.225
Our next destination was then pretty obvious.

00:00:15.725 --> 00:00:17.345
The dilemna with the French capital

00:00:17.345 --> 00:00:19.905
is that it is so rich and so diverse that we can  approach it

00:00:19.905 --> 00:00:21.555
through countless facets

00:00:22.115 --> 00:00:25.295
Historical Paris, Nightlife, Fashion

00:00:25.295 --> 00:00:28.365
Food, Art...

00:00:28.365 --> 00:00:31.365
As you are starting to guess, it is a weirder and lesser known Paris that

00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:31.865
I am going to talk about now

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:32.435
.

00:00:32.735 --> 00:00:35.885
So if you want to know what is lying in the shadows of the city of light

00:00:35.885 --> 00:00:37.195
Follow the guide.

00:00:53.865 --> 00:00:56.855
Centuries go by, the world changes but the aura of legend

00:00:56.855 --> 00:00:59.055
surrounding Paris remains the same

00:00:59.085 --> 00:01:01.085
with averageley more than 30 millions visitors each year

00:01:01.865 --> 00:01:05.040
the French capital never stops being one of the world's most visited city.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.700
this tourist attractivity is mostly due to its monuments: counting up to 2185, no less

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.320
Some are among the most famous of the globe

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.640
Our journey starts in front of the most visited one

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.320
And no, it's not the one you are thinking of

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.140
The Notre-Dame cathedral attracts more than 12 millions visitors each year

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.040
making it not only the most visited monument of Paris

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.300
but of Europe as well

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.620
And yet, among the thousands of people  gathering in front of the gothic cathedral each day

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.880
very few actually notice the oddity on its forecourt

00:01:34.645 --> 00:01:37.865
This little compass rose engraved in bronze is not only fullfilling a decorative fonction

00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:40.915
it is actually the reference point for all roads in France

00:01:40.915 --> 00:01:43.885
It means all the roads lenghts and distances from Paris

00:01:43.885 --> 00:01:46.325
to the other cities in the country are calculated from this point.

00:01:46.325 --> 00:01:48.480
The metal sheet was set up in 1924 but

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.700
it was removed in 1966 to build an underground parking lot

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.300
However the works led to important archaeological discoveries

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.225
under the forecourt of Notre-Dame. Works were then stopped

00:01:57.225 --> 00:02:00.400
and the compass rose was finally put back in 1972.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.880
A few minutes from the cathedral, in the René Viviani square

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.980
another monument raises. A vegetal one.

00:02:08.655 --> 00:02:11.655
15 metres high, this locust was planted in 1601

00:02:11.655 --> 00:02:14.065
making it the oldest tree in Paris

00:02:14.805 --> 00:02:17.825
It's arched-back demonstrates the weight of time

00:02:17.825 --> 00:02:20.145
and a concrete structure was built to support it.

00:02:21.895 --> 00:02:25.035
This natural treasure is being well-taken care of

00:02:25.035 --> 00:02:28.195
and is, since 2010, surrounded by a protective fence

00:02:28.865 --> 00:02:31.825
Despite this venerable elder being 400 years old

00:02:31.825 --> 00:02:34.425
the oldest house in Paris was almost

00:02:34.425 --> 00:02:37.335
200 years old already when it was planted.

00:02:37.335 --> 00:02:39.145
It's located on the 51, Montmorency street

00:02:39.145 --> 00:02:42.165
and was built in 1407 by the mysterious

00:02:42.165 --> 00:02:43.285
Nicolas Flamel

00:02:43.795 --> 00:02:45.215
Flamel was a rich bourgeois

00:02:45.215 --> 00:02:48.225
from Paris, who built a lot of housing

00:02:48.225 --> 00:02:51.245
for the destitute. The Montmorency house is the only one that survived times

00:02:51.245 --> 00:02:53.765
and on its pediment, renovated in 1900

00:02:53.765 --> 00:02:56.655
one can still read the original inscription

00:02:57.115 --> 00:03:00.045
It indicates that in return for bed and lodging, the inhabitants were to

00:03:00.045 --> 00:03:02.475
pray everyday. To explain the wealth of Nicholas Flamel

00:03:02.475 --> 00:03:03.425
the rumour made him an alchemist

00:03:03.425 --> 00:03:06.115
that discovered a way

00:03:06.115 --> 00:03:09.145
to turn lead into gold. This myth grew over time

00:03:09.145 --> 00:03:11.085
turning Flamel into a leading figure

00:03:11.085 --> 00:03:14.185
of esoteric litterature. And even more.

00:03:14.185 --> 00:03:17.225
He is even mentionned in the first Harry Potter's volume

00:03:17.225 --> 00:03:19.840
Nowadays, Nicholas Flamel's house is now a restaurant

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.980
and the only alchemy taking place here is food related.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.715
When you linger though the streets of Paris with curiosity

00:03:28.715 --> 00:03:31.025
you always end up finding an unusual detail

00:03:31.025 --> 00:03:34.145
-"Unusual, mate, that's exactly the word. Yeah I'm reading his mind.

00:03:34.145 --> 00:03:35.835
Hey, come this way if you want to see something strange in Paris, it's here !

00:03:39.005 --> 00:03:40.895
To be honest, I never understood this thing !"

00:03:41.735 --> 00:03:44.755
If that telepath passerby is so confused

00:03:44.755 --> 00:03:47.365
it is because of the discrepency between the modern architecture of those buildings

00:03:47.365 --> 00:03:49.505
and the flamboyance of their ornaments

00:03:49.505 --> 00:03:52.495
On each sides of the street, coming out of nowhere

00:03:52.495 --> 00:03:54.955
a naked woman and a stag-head man are holding balconies

00:03:54.955 --> 00:03:58.175
Those statues were sculpted in 1987 by the artist Philippe Rebuffet

00:03:58.175 --> 00:04:01.155
and they are rewriting a classic scene of greek mythology

00:04:01.155 --> 00:04:03.855
the meeting of Diana (Artemis) and Actaeon

00:04:03.855 --> 00:04:06.315
The myths goes that while hunting in the woods, the hunter Actaeon

00:04:06.315 --> 00:04:09.585
stumbled upon the goddess Diana taking a bath

00:04:09.715 --> 00:04:11.695
Enraged at the thoughts of being seen naked by a mere mortal

00:04:11.695 --> 00:04:14.135
she turned him into a stag

00:04:14.135 --> 00:04:16.825
Actaeon's own hounds then mistook him for game

00:04:16.825 --> 00:04:18.675
and turned against him. As you can see here.

00:04:19.795 --> 00:04:21.565
However a question remains:

00:04:21.805 --> 00:04:24.955
Why choosing this precise location to illustrate such a scene?

00:04:26.385 --> 00:04:29.345
Simply because we are located at the

00:04:29.345 --> 00:04:30.345
"Small deer alley" (Passage du petit-cerf)

00:04:32.265 --> 00:04:35.365
Paris is full of surprising fronts like this one

00:04:35.385 --> 00:04:37.485
Rue Saint Lazare you can even see a MacDonald's which front

00:04:37.485 --> 00:04:38.935
is classified as an historical building

00:04:41.985 --> 00:04:44.795
but to my knowledge the most remarkable front of the city

00:04:44.795 --> 00:04:47.395
is located on Avenue Rapp

00:04:47.925 --> 00:04:50.885
At number 29 the Lavirotte building

00:04:50.885 --> 00:04:53.885
is a residential building that was built between 1900 and 1901

00:04:53.885 --> 00:04:55.505
by the architect Jules Lavirotte

00:04:56.335 --> 00:04:58.455
6-floor-high

00:04:58.455 --> 00:05:00.785
the building is adorned with splendid Art Nouveau ornaments

00:05:00.785 --> 00:05:03.775
contrasting radically next to the other buildings

00:05:03.775 --> 00:05:06.825
Its asymetrical front is covered with ceramic and abundant decors

00:05:06.825 --> 00:05:09.325
But it is certainly the main entrance that is the most impressive part of it all

00:05:09.865 --> 00:05:12.915
Framed by elaborate designs, this spectacular entrance

00:05:12.915 --> 00:05:15.725
is watched over by the bust of a mysterious woman

00:05:16.045 --> 00:05:18.195
It is said to be the Architect's wife.

00:05:18.705 --> 00:05:21.705
The Lavirotte building won an award in the Paris front contest in 1901

00:05:21.705 --> 00:05:23.665
in the Paris front contest in 1901

00:05:24.055 --> 00:05:26.735
And nowadays, almost 120 years later

00:05:26.735 --> 00:05:28.865
Passerby still stop to take a look at it.

00:05:29.775 --> 00:05:31.375
Talking about curious people

00:05:31.375 --> 00:05:34.395
We are going to visit

00:05:34.395 --> 00:05:37.085
a cabinet of curiosities

00:05:37.085 --> 00:05:39.775
but not any cabinet of curiosities

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.925
At 46 Rue du Bac, Deyrolle's House is the last Parisian cabinet of curiosities,

00:05:42.925 --> 00:05:45.980
opened to the public, and it is also one of the oldest shop in the city

00:05:45.985 --> 00:05:48.520
founded in 1831

00:05:48.595 --> 00:05:51.245
Halfway between a natural history museum and an art gallery

00:05:51.245 --> 00:05:54.185
Deyrolle is an instititution when it comes to taxidermia

00:05:54.185 --> 00:05:56.580
And when you reach the first floor

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.820
you are greeted by a fascinating sight

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.480
Big cats, peacocks, giraffes,

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.600
The visitor is surrounded by stuffed animals.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.940
Offering a unique athmosphere as one gets further inside.

00:06:07.945 --> 00:06:11.395
I'll emphasize than no animal has been killed prior being displayed here.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.820
Deyrolles stuffed animals died from natural causes

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.580
either in zoo, parks or natural reserve.

00:06:16.765 --> 00:06:20.005
The place is just as renowned for its remarkable bug collection

00:06:20.005 --> 00:06:22.895
In the entomology room, one can open hundred of drawers

00:06:22.895 --> 00:06:26.115
filled with butterflies, spiders, and beetles.

00:06:27.205 --> 00:06:30.355
Once again, even if it does look a lot like a museum,

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.080
Deyrolle is really a store, and everything that is displayed there can be bought,

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.000
much to the delight of collectors.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.580
But this incredible place barely survived a few years ago.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:46.520
February 1st, 2008, a fire destroyed more than 90% of the collection, bugs and animals alike.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.880
Right away, lots of people

00:06:48.885 --> 00:06:51.895
helped save the shop. And today, like a phoenix,

00:06:51.895 --> 00:06:54.365
Deyrolle's house rise up from ashes.

00:06:55.845 --> 00:06:58.785
The place where I lead you now is very much alike

00:06:58.785 --> 00:07:01.645
this spirit of cabinet of curiosities

00:07:01.645 --> 00:07:04.295
But with two major differencies

00:07:04.295 --> 00:07:07.095
First of all, this is real museum. And the collections seen

00:07:07.095 --> 00:07:10.585
are more... organic. But before...

00:07:11.785 --> 00:07:12.975
It looks like...

00:07:14.825 --> 00:07:15.825
Patrick ?

00:07:16.245 --> 00:07:17.585
What are you doing here ?

00:07:18.415 --> 00:07:20.945
I'm doing my satanic invocations

00:07:21.555 --> 00:07:22.220
- Ok
- Because we are at Impasse Satan if you haven't seen it

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.145
Ah yes ! That's true

00:07:23.815 --> 00:07:26.215
- Yes, and do you know the story behind it?
- Not at all

00:07:26.285 --> 00:07:29.185
- Let me tell you now because you can't do more bizarre
- How interesting!

00:07:29.475 --> 00:07:32.095
- So, in 1907, it was a private road
- Ok

00:07:32.505 --> 00:07:35.455
- in which lived a humorist, and as we are near the Passage Dieu (Passage of God)

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:38.535
He decided to name his private road l'Impasse Satan (Satan dead-end)

00:07:38.535 --> 00:07:40.880
- Good catch!
- A humorist pun

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.600
We like it

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.540
The townhall didn't care, it was a private road

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.235
And in 1991, when it became a public road

00:07:47.235 --> 00:07:49.725
The town kept the name of Impasse Satan

00:07:49.725 --> 00:07:52.535
- And now it's still called Impasse Satan of Paris
- The perfect place for

00:07:52.535 --> 00:07:55.185
- any incantation
- It's perfect. I come here

00:07:55.185 --> 00:07:57.745
to do all my satanic rituals, and it relieves me

00:07:57.745 --> 00:08:00.165
That and stoping eating meat...

00:08:00.835 --> 00:08:03.495
- Thank you very much for this story
- With pleasure

00:08:03.495 --> 00:08:05.475
It's unbelievable to meet you here. See you later !

00:08:05.475 --> 00:08:07.385
- See you next time.
- I'm going back to my stuff

00:08:10.425 --> 00:08:11.425


00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:15.620


00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.080
Chating with this young satanic adept, I realise

00:08:29.085 --> 00:08:32.380
that Paris streets and their features deserve their own video

00:08:32.675 --> 00:08:35.015
Here, for exemple, we are climbing the Rue des degrés (uncommon word for steps)

00:08:35.885 --> 00:08:39.005
Its name comes from its unique feature : a stair

00:08:39.005 --> 00:08:40.060
of 14 steps

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.120
The street is only 5.76m long

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.320
It's the shortest street of Paris

00:08:47.005 --> 00:08:49.935
Let's return to the subject, and not any kind of subject

00:08:49.935 --> 00:08:53.025
The museum I was speaking of earlier is located at the Veterinary School

00:08:53.025 --> 00:08:54.405
of Maisons Alfort

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.700
Fragonard Musuem is one of the oldest musuem in France

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.480
It opened in 1766, along with the school

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.880
which, that being said, is the second veterinary school to be created

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.160
Just after the creation of the Lyon school

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.520
The musuem hosts more than 4200 subjects in tall

00:09:08.525 --> 00:09:11.225
display cases and is divided in four rooms

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.845
The first room is dedicated to Comparative anatomy

00:09:14.845 --> 00:09:18.240
You can see a great number of organs that helped students when learning anatomy differences

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.645
between several species. Most of these

00:09:20.645 --> 00:09:22.995
pieces are plaster reproductions realised more than one century ago

00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:25.625
one century ago by the assistant Eugène Petitcolin

00:09:26.175 --> 00:09:29.205
Some of them are so realistic that they are considered as much pieces

00:09:29.205 --> 00:09:30.555
of art as scientific subjects

00:09:31.185 --> 00:09:34.185
A part of the collection is dedicated to Teratology

00:09:34.195 --> 00:09:35.875
or the study of monsters

00:09:36.465 --> 00:09:39.335
There is a selection of congenital abnormalities like two-headed calves

00:09:39.335 --> 00:09:40.845
