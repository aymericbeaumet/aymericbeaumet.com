title: Behold z, the unsung jewel that rethinks shell navigation
tags: [macos, shell, zsh]

I spend a fair amount of time wandering around in the terminal. The chances
are that you are too since you dared to open this story. My daily activities
led me to contribute to various kinds of projects (professional, personal and
open-source). For my sanity, I tend to follow strict rules to organize my
workspace, which helps me keep things tidied up and easily reachable. Or so I
thought.

I decided to arrange my projects by following the [Go
philosophy](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces): make the
arborescence mirrors the urls where they are reachable. e.g.,
`~/Workspace/src/github.com/aymericbeaumet/dotfiles` would contain the
project [dotfiles](https://github.com/aymericbeaumet/dotfiles) owned by
[@aymericbeaumet](https://github.com/aymericbeaumet) and accessible at
[github.com](https://github.com). That's great, but I am now facing a complex
directory structure tedious to navigate quickly. Making it, in the end,
harder to access the resources I need.

```bash
$ pwd
/Users/aymericbeaumet/Workspace/src/github.com/brigad/back-end
```

_Nobody wants to manually deal with this._

Remembering and typing the location of each project (even while leveraging
autocomplete) is time-consuming. Creating shell aliases is not scalable.
Instead, I would like to rely on the pseudo-unicity of each project name to
find it among all the directories on my computer.

## z?

Several tools exist to tackle this problem. My favorite is
[_z_](https://github.com/rupa/z). It follows the Unix philosophy by being
small, focused and interoperable. _z_ allows jumping around swiftly,
automatically learning from your habits. The entries are ranked based on the
[frecency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frecency) at which you access the
directories.

Let’s walk through the basics of this tool. Below is how I advise to install
it for Zsh on macOS (the install process should be similar for other shells
and operating systems):

```bash
$ brew install z
$ echo "source '$(brew --prefix z)/etc/profile.d/z.sh'" >> ~/.zshenv
```

_Install z for Zsh on macOS._

Note how installing _z_ is not enough to start using it. You have to source
`z.sh` at the beginning of each shell session to activate it. The `~/.zshenv`
configuration file is appropriate as Zsh [loads it in most
circumstances](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Intro/intro_3.html), making the
tool accessible in a wide-variety of contexts (terminals, editors, IDEs,
scripts, etc.).

## Let’s play

Once the install and setup are complete: start a new shell session, `cd`
through some folders and execute `z` to confirm it has been accurately
tracking your activity:

```bash
$ z | sort -rn | head -3
5331.72    /Users/aymericbeaumet/Workspace/src/github.com/brigad/back-end
637.255    /Users/aymericbeaumet/Workspace/src/github.com/brigad/ops
386.198 /Users/aymericbeaumet/.config/dotfiles
```

_Top 3 directories based on frecency._

As shown above, I spend quite some time navigating through
[Brigad](https://github.com/brigad) projects, but it seems I also often
access my [dotfiles](https://github.com/aymericbeaumet/dotfiles) to tweak
some configuration. The ranking score is volatile, and one could observe
significant changes in a brief amount of time.

Now that _z_ has accumulated some knowledge try it by navigating to one of
the tracked folders. Navigating is as simple as executing the `z` command
followed by the directory name:

```bash
$ z dotfiles
$ pwd
/Users/aymericbeaumet/.config/dotfiles
```

_Navigating by matching with a whole directory name._

As a matter of facts, I do prefer to leverage partial matching (imagine `**`
surrounding your search pattern) to type fewer characters. Hence, `z dot` is
valid and should produce a similar behavior as `z dotfiles` (modulo possible
name collisions, but you get the idea). This works because _z_ relies on
regular expressions. For example, the snippet below will navigate to the
directory ending with the letters “tmp” (with the highest score):

```bash
$ z tmp$
$ pwd
/private/tmp
```

_Navigating by matching with a regular expression._

Neat right? I guess you start seeing the possibilities of this tool. And we
have only scratched the surface of its capabilities. I suggest you dive in
its [documentation](https://github.com/rupa/z/blob/master/README) to get an
idea of its full potential. Features such as autocomplete, subdirectories
matching, consecutive matching, etc. are a game changer.

## Conclusion

_z_ is tremendous. This tool saves me a non-trivial amount of time every
single day. When one starts relying on it, there is no going back. And I hope
it’s going to fit your workflow as well as mine.

I would be grateful to hear any of your time-saving tricks. Feel free to
share your experiences!
