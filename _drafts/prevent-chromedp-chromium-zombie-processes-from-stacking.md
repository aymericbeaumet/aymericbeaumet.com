title: Prevent chromedp Chromium zombie processes from stacking

I have recently been playing with
[chromedp](https://github.com/chromedp/chromedp) in order to programatically
control a Chrome browser to extract some informations from specific websites. I
have some experience doing a similar task in Node.js, and I was really happy to
be able to leverage a strongly typed language for the job.

Going back and forth between the documentation and the examples, everything went
as expected. Vim on the left side of my terminal, zsh on the right side showing
me the output as the code was re-run by [watchexec](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec).

Further down the coding session, I suddenly heard my MacBook Pro fans running
crazy, similar to what's happening when a `brew install` is not going as
expected and you are recompiling all the dependencies required by your
formula. This was accompanied by an increasing slowness.

A quick look at the [activity monitor](/resources/chromium_zombies.png) revealed
that Chromium processes were not disposed as expected. They actually were using
a lot of RAM, and my computer started to swap (hence the percepted slowness).

A quick `pkill Chromium` got me out of trouble. But now remains the question:
how to prevent this from happening in the future? A quick search on Google led
me to the chromedp issue tracker, where this has already [been
reported](https://github.com/chromedp/chromedp/issues/472). This issue is now
closed, but people still seem to experience it. If you are also experiencing the
problem feel free to react there, this will give an idea of the number of people
impacted by this problem.

In the meantime, I was looking for a temporary solution that would prevent the
zombie processes from stacking (and eating my RAM). As it happens, the Chromium
processes are spawned with the same user as the Go process (as expected). That
means it should be possible to kill them from within the Go process. I quickly
tried this with the following code:

```go
func main() {
	ctx, cancel := chromedp.NewContext(context.Background())
	defer func() {
		cancel()
		// We shouldn't need to do this, but some Chromium instances are otherwise hanging
		if _, err := exec.Command("pkill", "Chromium").Output(); err != nil {
			log.Println("Failed to kill Chromium processes", err)
		}
	}()

  // ...
}
```

It is not as chirurgical as I would like it to be as all the Chromium processes
on a given machine would die, but this works. Also I'm not using Chromium as my
daily browser, so this doesn't impact me. But then I started to write this blog
post, and I was sure at some point someone would face this issue while also
using Chromium as its main browser. So I started digging.

As it turns out, `man pkill` gives us the solution. `pkill` (and `pgrep`) does
support an option allowing to restrict the process to which the signal should be
sent to only be descendant of a specific _pid_ (or said otherwise: all the
processes whose parent is _pid_). This is done by providing the `-P <pid>` flag.

Once the code is adjusted as below, only the Chromium processes started by the
Go process will be killed:

```go
exec.Command("pkill", "-P", strconv.Itoa(os.Getpid()), "Chromium").Output()
```

Hopefully the issue will be adressed in the near future, but in the meantime
this solution proves to work, and is supported by any platform that has the
`pkill` (or similar) command.
