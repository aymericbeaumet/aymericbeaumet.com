title: Prevent chromedp Chromium zombie processes from stacking
tags: [golang, chromedp, chromium, macos]

I have recently been playing with
[chromedp](https://github.com/chromedp/chromedp) in order to programmatically
control a Chromium browser to scrape some information. I have some memories from
implementing a similar task in Node.js, and I was pleased to leverage a strongly
typed language for the job.

_TLDR: if you are looking for the solution, look for the last code snippet at
the end of the post._

I was able to quickly start experimenting by following the
[examples](https://github.com/chromedp/examples) and browsing the
[documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/chromedp/chromedp). For the
record, this is what the chromedp hello world looks like:


```go
func main() {
	ctx, cancel := chromedp.NewContext(context.Background())
	defer cancel()

	if err := chromedp.Run(
		ctx,
		chromedp.Navigate("https://github.com"),
	); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}
```

Not so long after I started getting results, I suddenly heard my MacBook Pro
fans running crazy. Similar to what's happening when a `brew install` is not
going as expected, and you feel like you are recompiling gcc from scratch. This
was accompanied by a weirdly unpleasant gentle warmth on my hands and an
increasing slowness on the MacOS UI.

A quick look at the [activity monitor](/resources/chromium_zombies.png) revealed
that the Chromium processes were not terminated as expected. They were also
using a lot of RAM, and forced my computer to swap (hence the perceived
slowness).

A swift `pkill Chromium` got me out of trouble. But now remains the question:
how to prevent this from happening in the future? A quick search on Google led
me to the chromedp issue tracker, were several
[resolved](https://github.com/chromedp/chromedp/issues/81)
[issues](https://github.com/chromedp/chromedp/issues/289) are talking about this
very problem. You can follow the latest updates
[here](https://github.com/chromedp/chromedp/issues/752).

In the meantime, I was looking for a temporary solution that would prevent the
zombie processes from stacking (and eating my RAM). As it happens, the Chromium
processes are spawned with the same user as the Go process. That means it should
theoratically be possible to kill them from within the Go process right before
it dies. I quickly tried to confirm this theory with the following code:

```go
func main() {
	ctx, cancel := chromedp.NewContext(context.Background())
	defer func() {
		cancel()
		if _, err := exec.Command("pkill", "Chromium").Output(); err != nil {
			log.Println("[warn] Failed to kill Chromium processes", err)
		}
	}()

	// ...
}
```

It is not as accurate as I would like it to be, as all the Chromium processes on
my machine would die, but this works. That being said, I'm not using Chromium as
my primary browser, so I'm not really impacted. But then came the time to write
this blog post, and I was sure at some point someone would face this issue _and_
would also be using Chromium as its primary browser. So I started digging.

As it turns out, `man pkill` gives us some leads to explore. `pkill` (and
`pgrep` for that matters, as they share most of their options) does support a
flag allowing to restrict the processes receiving the signal to only the
descendants of a specific PID (or said otherwise: all the processes whose parent
is PID).  This is achieved by providing the `-P <pid>` flag.

Once the code is adjusted to leverage the
[`os.Getpid()`](https://golang.org/pkg/os/#Getpid) function, only the Chromium
processes started by the Go process will be killed:

```go
_, err := exec.Command("pkill", "-P", strconv.Itoa(os.Getpid()), "Chromium").Output()
```

Or so I thought. This actually doesn't work. As it turns out, the Chrome
processes are not directly attached to the Go process as there are intermediate
forks. So trying to match the parent process will not work.

While looking at the activity monitor, I noticed there was something else than
the parent PID mentioned: the process group PID. A quick look at the [Wikipedia
page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_group) reads:

> In a POSIX-conformant operating system, a process group denotes a collection
> of one or more processes. Among other things, a process group is used to
> control the distribution of a signal; when a signal is directed to a process
> group, the signal is delivered to each process that is a member of the group.

This encouraged me to continue in that direction. Reading `man ps` taught me the
`ps -g` flag, which allows listing all the processes belonging to a given
process group (in this case of the Go process group PID _46499_):

```bash
$ ps -g 46499
  PID TTY           TIME CMD
46499 ttys001    0:00.77 go run .
46518 ttys001    0:38.43 /var/folders/dg/3zgc8tkd0wg7d0zc0mst6jc00000gn/T/go-build917574381/b001/exe/scraper
46520 ttys001    0:01.72 /Applications/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium --disable-popup-blocking --safebr
46521 ttys001    0:00.80 /Applications/Chromium.app/Contents/Frameworks/Chromium Framework.framework/Versions
46522 ttys001    0:08.18 /Applications/Chromium.app/Contents/Frameworks/Chromium Framework.framework/Versions
```

This lists all the Chromium processes created by the Go process! We are getting
close to what we want. As it turns out, `pkill` also supports the `-g` flag. So
changing the code as follows should behave as expected:

```go
_, err := exec.Command("pkill", "-g", strconv.Itoa(os.Getpid()), "Chromium").Output()
```

But it doesn't. If you look carefully at the `ps` command above, you can see the
actual `scraper` process, but above is the `go run .` process. This is the
process that created the group. So we should be careful to use its PID instead.
In Go, you can get the PID of the parent process with
[os.Getppid()](https://golang.org/pkg/os/#Getppid), which gives us:

```go
_, err := exec.Command("pkill", "-g", strconv.Itoa(os.Getppid()), "Chromium").Output()
```

And finally, it works as expected, at least! Well, it works when we `go run .`.
What happens when we `go build`? I will let you try, but I can tell you it
doesn't work. The reason is that the group process is no longer the one created
by _go run_, but the one created by the binary itself as we run it directly. So
we need to account for that when we infer the group process PID from the code.

An easy solution is to try to `pkill` both for the current pid _and_ the parent
pid. As long as they don't both fail, it means we have succeeded to kill all the
zombie processes:

```go
_, errA := exec.Command("pkill", "-g", strconv.Itoa(os.Getppid()), "Chromium").Output()
_, errB := exec.Command("pkill", "-g", strconv.Itoa(os.Getpid()), "Chromium").Output()
```

This works. But I don't really find this elegant as we expect at least half of
the `pkill` commands to fail. Can we take it one step further? Let's have a look
at `man pkill`:

```
-g pgrp     Restrict matches to processes with a process group ID in the comma-separated list
            pgrp.  The value zero is taken to mean the process group ID of the running pgrep
            or pkill command.
```

Reading this teaches us we could pass a comma-separated list of PID to `-g`,
which enables to only call `pkill` once by passing both the PPID and the PID at
the same time. But the second part of the description is actually much more
interesting: by passing `0` we ask `pkill` to infer for us what is the current
process group PID. That greatly simplifies the code by moving this
responsability out of Go. Which gives us:

```go
func main() {
	ctx, cancel := chromedp.NewContext(context.Background())
	defer func() {
		cancel()
		// Prevent Chromium processes from hanging
		if _, err := exec.Command("pkill", "-g", "0", "Chromium").Output(); err != nil {
			log.Println("[warn] Failed to kill Chromium processes", err)
		}
	}()

	// ...
}
```

And there we have it, this piece of code kills all the Chromium processes that
have been started by the Go process, without impacting any other Chromium
process that would be running on your system. This is the snippet I'm currently
using in my project. Until the issue is fixed upstream.

I hope you enjoyed the journey we took to get there. It is enjoyable how
sometimes a simple problem will lead you into challenging your knowledge on
something you thought was well inside your comfort zone. Only to remind you you
can always get further.
