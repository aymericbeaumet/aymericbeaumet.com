My name's Aymeric, I'm a Software Engineer from France. These days I'm mainly
working on a Go and Kubernetes stack as an Infrastructure Team Lead for
[REKKI](https://rekki.com/). I'm also enjoying working with Rust and doing some
data science and machine learning with Python.

On this blog you will be able to find posts of variable lenghts, some of them
are actually just notes of mine, some are more detailed walkthrough on specific
topics I had the chance to dive on. I also cross-post these posts on
[dev.to](https://dev.to/@aymericbeaumet).

My contact informations are in the footer, feel free to get in touch.
